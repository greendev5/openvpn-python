openvpn-python
--------------

Plug-in embedding Python to OpenVPN using V2 API.

Purpose
-------

OpenVPN can to execute user-defined scripts for handling 
different types of events like connect, disconnect, auth.

But while user-defined script is running main OpenVPN process
is blocked and not processing existed or new connection.

The common solution of this problem is to write OpenVPN plugin on c/c++
programming languages. Plug-in API allow you to write handlers of 
client events without blocking the main OpenVPN process.

With openvpn-python you can use python code for handling
clinet events without blocking the main OpenVPN process and without
writing additional libraries on C/C++.

Build from release branch
-------------------------

Requirements: python2.7, python2.7-dev

1.  Download the package.
2.  Unpack it.
3.  Go to the root directory of the package.
4.  ./configure
5.  make
6.  Use openvpn-python.so from .libs folder

Build from development branch
-----------------------------

Requirements: python2.7, python2.7-dev, autotools

1.  Download the package.
2.  Unpack it.
3.  Go to the root directory of the package.
4.  ./autogen.sh
5.  ./configure
6.  make
7.  Use openvpn-python.so from .libs folder

Usage
-----

Create config file from openvpn-python with next options:

pythonpath - Additional python path

mod_plugin_up - Module with plugin_up function

func_plugin_up - plugin_up function

mod_plugin_down

func_plugin_down

mod_auth_user_pass_verify

func_auth_user_pass_verify

mod_client_connect

func_client_connect

mod_client_disconnect

func_client_disconnect

See example settings_ovpnpy.conf in examples folder.

Create python module (or few) for handling events.

See example ovpn_test_module.py in examples folder.

Run OpenVPN with option:

--plugin path_to/openvpn-python.so path_to/settings_test.conf
